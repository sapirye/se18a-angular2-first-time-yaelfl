<i>
First of all you're being asked which of the Firebase client features you want to use. Select the option Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting site. Next the Firebase client will ask which folder to use for deployment. Type in dist. That is important because that is the location where our production build is stored.

Next the question is ask if this app is a single page app and if it should rewrite all URLs to index.html. In our case we need to answer yes.

Last question is if Firebase should over write file index.html. The answer to that question is no.

now run: <br>$ firebase deploy
